It predicts the label of a query point by looking at the k closest training points, usually measured using Euclidean distance, and taking a majority vote or average. Since kNN doesn't learn an explicit model during training and just stores the data, it's often referred to as a lazy learner. Choosing a very small value of k typically makes the model more robust to noisy data. Feature scaling matters a lot for kNN since it relies on distance calculations. kNN has a training time complexity of O(n log n) due to the tree structures used internally."""
